## Description
THis is a repository containing the grader.js which is a grade generator, salary.js which calculates deductions based on salary and benefits and speed.js which calculates the speed of a car and gives points.

## Installation
You can use fork and clone the repository to be able to have the code in your local development environment so as to be able to test it out.

## Installation Requirements
Git
Chrome browser as all code is meant to be tested in the chrome browser developer tools console.
Ensure to test in the browser console as testing in a linux terminal will fail due to lack of some code implementations.

### Installation instruction

```
Git clone https://github.com/BettKev/sa01_WK1_Code_Challenge.git

```

Open you terminal and navigate to the project directory. This is relative to where you cloned the project in your local environment and will vary from user to user.
Inside the project directory which should i.e "./sa01_WK1_Code_Challenge" you will find three separate files these are:

```
1. speed.js
2. salary.js
3. grader.js
These are the files related to each question and each file contains a separate solution.

```

Note: You have to copy the code inside the files to your browser console to be able to test them as they use a "prompt()" method to request for input and this method does not work in the terminal. That requires a whole new line of code which i will leave to you to figure out.
