## Description
This is a repository containing the grader.js which is a grade generator, salary.js which calculates tax deductions based on salary and benefits and speed.js which calculates the speed of a car and gives points. All the code require a user to input values to run the code.

## Installation
You can fork and clone this repository to be able to have the code in your local development environment so as to be able to test it out.

## Installation Requirements
Git

Any code editor preferably visual studio code

Chrome browser 

All the code is meant to be tested in the chrome browser developer tools console since testing in a linux terminal will fail due to lack of some code implementations.

### Installation instruction

```
Git clone https://github.com/BettKev/sa01_WK1_Code_Challenge.git

```

Open you terminal and navigate to the project directory. This is relative to where you cloned the project in your local environment and will vary from user to user.

Inside the project directory which you cloned i.e "./sa01_WK1_Code_Challenge" you will find three separate files these are:

```
1. speed.js
2. salary.js
3. grader.js

```
Open the files using any code editor of preference and copy it to your chrome browser developer tools console. These files include both the question for reference and solution however the questions have been commented out to prevent errors. You do not need to copy the questions for the code to run

Note: You have to copy the code inside the files to your browser console to be able to test them as they use a "prompt()" method to request for input and this method does not work in the terminal. That requires a whole new line of code which i will leave to you to figure out.
